	<h1>“A Winter Morning is &lt;then a Summer morning &amp; &gt; more” </h1>
	<p>
		Winter in Bangladesh is a season of beauty. The nature of winter morning is calm and sweet. The leaves of the trees, the fields of crops, and the green grass of the fields are all filled with misty dew. The entire nature is covered in a blanket of fog. When the sun rises, the fog begins to disappear. People wear warm clothes in the morning. But homeless people face really tough situations. They don’t get enough warm clothes or even a place to sleep. This season is very difficult for them. Some warm themselves with fire. Thus, they keep them warm. Winter is the best time for vegetables and fruits. We can enjoy a variety of food on winter mornings. At this time we usually eat Pitha,&nbsp;Cake,&nbsp;Pies,&nbsp;etc.
